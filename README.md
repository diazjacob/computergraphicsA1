A link to my first computer graphics assignment in COMP3490. This assignment tasked us with creating arender engine in Processing with only direct OpenGL calls. We were required to understand the full graphics pipeline including:

- Rasterization
- Raster vs. vector graphics
- Orthographic, perspective, and isometric projections
- View frustrums
- The matrix stack
- 3D object parameterizations
- Face vertex windings
- Polygon collision methods
- Normals
- Many common linear algebra concepts
- Phong lighting
- Gouraud shading
- Object texturing
- UV mapping
- Homogeneous coordinate systems

This first assignment uses a lot of these concepts to implement a working graphics pipeline.

To test, open the Assign1Handout.pde file, and press play. You can see all demo controls at the top of the Modes.pde file!
